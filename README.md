## **How to Use It**

### **1. Adding Images**
- **Via URL**: Enter the image URL in the input field and click the "Add Image" button.
- **Via Drag and Drop**: Click the "Drop" button, drag and drop an image into the drop zone, or click "Choose Image" to upload a file from your device.

### **2. Managing Images**

- **Delete Images**: Click the "Delete" button to remove an image from the gallery.
- **Share Images**: Click the "Share" button to copy the image link to your clipboard.

### **4. Viewing Images**

## **How It Works**

### **1. Adding and Displaying Images**
- Images are added either via URL or file upload.
- When an image is added, it is displayed in a grid layout within the gallery.
- Image data (URL and description) is stored in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring persistence across page reloads.

### **2. Drag and Drop Functionality**
- The drop zone allows users to drag and drop image files or click to upload them.
- The `FileReader` API reads the uploaded file and converts it into a data URL, which is then displayed in the gallery.

### **3. Descriptions and Search**
- Descriptions are saved alongside images in `localStorage`.
- The search functionality filters images based on the description text, dynamically updating the gallery display.

### **4. Sharing Images**
- The "Share" button copies the image URL to the clipboard using the `execCommand("copy")` method.

### **5. Responsive Design**
- The gallery is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, with a responsive layout and touch-friendly interactions.

### **6. Typewriter Animation**
- The header "Pixel Eye" features a typewriter animation, created using CSS keyframes and JavaScript, to give the app a dynamic and engaging feel.

## **Tech Stack**
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations, including the typewriter effect and modal designs.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for adding, deleting, searching, and sharing images, as well as handling drag-and-drop functionality.
- **LocalStorage**: Persists image data across page reloads.
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for the search button and other UI elements.

## **Things to Keep in Mind**

While Pixel Eye is designed to be user-friendly and functional, there are a few things you should be aware of to ensure the best experience:

### **1. Local Storage Limitations**
- **Data Persistence**: Pixel Eye uses the browser's `localStorage` to save image URLs and descriptions. This means:
  - If you switch browsers, your gallery data will be lost.
  - `localStorage` has a size limit (usually around 5-10 MB depending on the browser). If you add too many high-resolution images, you may run out of storage space.

### **2. Browser Compatibility**
- **Supported Browsers**: Pixel Eye works best on modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. Older browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer) may not support some features like `localStorage` or drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Solution**: Always use an updated browser for the best experience.

### **3. Image Size and Performance**
- **Large Images**: Uploading very large images (e.g., high-resolution photos) may slow down the gallery, especially on low-end devices or browsers with limited resources.
- **Solution**: Resize images before uploading to ensure optimal performance.

### **5. Security Considerations**
- **External URLs**: Be cautious when adding images from external URLs. Malicious URLs or scripts could potentially harm your system.
- **Solution**: Only use trusted sources for image URLs.
